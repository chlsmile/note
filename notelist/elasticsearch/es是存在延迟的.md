Elasticsearch provides data manipulation and search capabilities in near real time. By default, you can expect a one second delay (refresh interval) from the time you index/update/delete your data until the time that it appears in your search results. This is an important distinction from other platforms like SQL wherein data is immediately available after a transaction is completed.
